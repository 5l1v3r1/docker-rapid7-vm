#### Contributing to docker-rapid7-vm

The users and maintainers of docker-rapid7-vm would greatly appreciate any contributions you can make to the project. 
These contributions typically come in the form of filed bugs/issues or pull requests (PRs). Once approved and merged, 
contributions will be included with tagged releases.

Currently a work in progress, but in the future new versions of the images will be published to [Docker Console image](https://hub.docker.com/u/rapid7/rapid7-vm-console)
and [Docker Engine image](https://hub.docker.com/u/rapid7/rapid7-vm-engine).

#### Contributing Issues / Bug Reports

If you encounter any bugs or problems with the Docker images, please file them 
[here](https://github.com/rapid7/docker-rapid7-vm/issues/new), providing as much detail as possible. If the bug is 
simple and you feel comfortable making the fix, feel free making a Pull Request to help contribute to the community.

#### Contributing Enhancements

When contributing enhancements to the repository, please ensure the PR template is filled out fully with details of how 
the changes were tested, the reasoning for the changes, and environment details.  While we encourage community 
contributions, not all PRs will be merged as they may not fit the holistic purpose of this project.  If you intend to
 extend the functionality for your own purposes, feel free to fork the repository and work with it as you please.
 
When contributing, please leverage your own fork of the repo, create a 
[pull request](https://github.com/rapid7/docker-rapid7-vm/pulls) with the change, and then a 
maintainer will review the changes prior to merging and building a new image.
